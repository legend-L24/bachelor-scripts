## kQEq - Kernel Charge Equilibration

kQEq is a Python implementation of the kernel Charge Equilibration method (more [here](https://doi.org/xxx>) ). This allows training and using physics-based machine-learning models for predicting charge distributions in molecules and materials.

Detailed documentation is provided [here](https://jmargraf.gitlab.io/kqeq)


# Installation

This package has been tested with python 3.9. External dependencies are [numpy](https://numpy.org) (for linear algebra), [ase](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (for handling structural data) and [DScribe](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/) (for calculating atomic environment representations). The kQEq package and its dependencies can be installed using ``pip install .``
