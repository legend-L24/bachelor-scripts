API
************


This document provides an outline of the implemented interfaces to our code. A more descriptive documentation can be found in the tutorial. 

TODO: This document should give an outline of the available main classes and the user exposed functions (those the user will definetly use). It should be a systematic description of the API. For helper functions that are to be hidden from the user, please add a _ in front of the functions name, i.e. :code:`kqeq._block_diag` instead of :code:`kqeq.block_diag`.
